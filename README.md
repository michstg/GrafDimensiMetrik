# Python Metric Dimensions on a Branched Prism Graph

One graph that can be formed as a dual graph is a prism graph. Prism graph (Pm,n) is a graph formed from the results of a cartesian product of a cycle graph with a line graph. The theoretical approach used is linear algebra and abstract algebra. I tried to do programming use two states, when n = 2 and m â‰¥ 3.
